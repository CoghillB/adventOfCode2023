Welcome to Advent of Code!

This repository contains a few helper functions to get you started.

First, run AdventUtilities.main().

This will create a separate directory for each day, and populate them each with a .java file and two .txt files.

The java file will have a main method set up, as well as a variable "input" declared and initialized to read
each line from the corresponding day's text file as an ArrayList.

There is another function provided in AdventUtilities in case you want your whole input read in one long String.

Copy your puzzle input into the text file, and you will be ready to start solving!

The other text file is for test cases you may wish to run on smaller inputs while troubleshooting.

Good luck, and have fun!
